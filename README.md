GraffitiWall
============

built during HackZurich'14


It's all about context! The right information at the right time.
bWall provides you an innovative way to leave comments, selfies or other fun or usefull stuff at a specific position. It is a mixture of a modern guestbook, a graffiti and a feedback survey.

Discover awesome stuff, left there by locals or avoid picking the wrong restaurant or hackathon :P
